# Basic QRadar Dashboard Item Showing Event Latency
This repository is python (2.x) and flash code to implement a basic dashboard item for IBM QRadar 7.3.1 (and portable for 7.3.2).

To use the code, you can either use the IBM App Editor and pull in the code directly, or zip the repository up and import as a zip file locally.

Notes:
* The code is developed using the version of Python used at hte time (2.x in this case), noting that official support for Python 2.x ends 31/12/2019. This is a limitation and nothing the author can do about it.
* You need a working IBM QRadar SIEM to import the code. It should import and operate in the IBM QRadar "community edition" as well as full versions of QRadar.
